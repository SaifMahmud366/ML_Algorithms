## README

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The algorithms are designed to be easy to use and efficient, and they cover a wide range of tasks, including:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Clustering
* KNN
* SVM

## How to use
To use the algorithms, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the following Python libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can import the algorithms from this repository and use them to train and evaluate your own machine learning models.
